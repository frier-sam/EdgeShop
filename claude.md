**Plan everything, dont take short cuts for making things work**

1: look at project.md for details of what we're building
2: check plan.md to see what is built or what needs to be built
3: if no plan.md then generate it with detailed tasks 
4: after completing a task update the plan.md along with some important decision made at the end of file.
5: ask for any major clarifications required instead of taking a decision yourself
6: main requirement is that theme is decoupled so multiple themes can be given that can be chosen in admin panel
